## FaceTo Mini

#### Description

Welcome developer. 
Here you will find the implementation of my personal project of creating a puzzle game. The idea for the puzzle came about by accident and I wasn't sure if it could actually work properly. 

Therefore, a puzzle engine was first developed to determine how the puzzle would be twisted and folded, and then a small application was written around the engine. The frontend part of the project was developed using the Flutter framework, as well as some additional tools, the backend was implemented in PHP with MySQLi. For a more detailed description of how the puzzle works, see the article on [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/articles/598995/).

 Puzzle design has become a fun way to learn and improve your Flutter skills.
